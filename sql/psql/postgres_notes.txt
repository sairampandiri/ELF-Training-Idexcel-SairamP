syntax for alter command :

add column by using alter command:

	alter table table_name add column column_name datatype:

add column by using alter command:

	alter table table_name drop column column_name :

rename column name by using alter command:
	
	alter table table_name rename column old_column_name to new_column_name:
	
rename table name by using alter command:

	alter table old_table_name rename to new_table_name;

DML:

syntax for insert  command:
	insert into table_name(column_name1,column_name2,column_name3 ,column_name4,.........,column_name n)
	values (value1,value2,value3,value4,.......,value n);

DQL:
========
select command----> It helps to retrive the data from table.

3 different ways to retrive the data from the table:

1. projection   eg----->select *  from employee;

select * /[Distinct name]column_name/expression[alias] from table_name;

eg----->select *  from employee;


eg----->select ename from employee;


update:
============
eg----->update employee  set salary=25000.00;

========
eg----->update table_name set column_name=value;
eg----->update employee set sal=30000.00 where empid=8;

delete:
============
delete form employee;


syntax:
============
delete from table_name;
delete from employee where empid=9;

synatx for where clause:
=================
select column1,cloumn2/* from table_name where condition;
order of execution:
eg------>select  * from employee empid=3;

A.  select designation job_type from employee;
		or
      select designation as job_type from employee;
